This is the  constraint programming used for search the best the differential and linear trails of Gaston-S and SBD for all states.




## Usage of the codes 


minizinc --solver "chuffed" -a -D "nr = 3" --time-limit 720000000 --output-time --statistics xxx.mzn > xxx_result.txt


## Results

The results will be shown in _xxx_result.txt


Note that the weights displayed in the results are multiplied by 100, for example 15500 means the weight of the tail is 155
