This is the  constraint programming used for search the best the differential and linear trails of Gaston-S and SBD for the states in the kenerl with 6/8/10 active bits at first or second round.


## Usage of the codes 

'python start.py 1'  to search for the the best the differential and linear trails of Gaston-S for the states in the kenerl with 6/8/10

'python start.py 2'  to search for the the best the differential and linear trails of SBD for the states in the kenerl with 6/8/10


## Results

The results will be shown in the directory like "Gaston_S/diif/iterative_calls_3nr_6sbox/Our_results_..." 

Note that the weights displayed in the results are multiplied by 100, for example 15500 means the weight of the tail is 155
